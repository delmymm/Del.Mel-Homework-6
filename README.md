The traveler is able to search a city and get the following:
    Current Temp
    Wind Speed
    Humidity
    UV index

Particular colors in the uv index tell the user whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. 

List of past searches allows user to go back to a city and see weather once again.

** NOTE ** not the prettiest but I was focused on getting the API's and local storage to work properly.
